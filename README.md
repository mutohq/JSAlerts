JSAlerts
========
A JavaScript Library for simplifying notifications based on asynchronous Promises.

Features
========
1. Notifications can be placed anywhere on the screen. Complete control on position exists.
2. A bunch of parameters can be used to customize pretty much everything in a notification.
3. Any animation/transition can be added. Also, a bunch of transitions will be provided.
4. Cross browser support.
5. No dependencies --> written completely in JavaScript (Browser must support Promises, though).
6. Very minimal. Goal is to have a non-minified version within 20kB.

Completed
=========
1. Notifications can be placed anywhere on the screen.
2. Any animations can be used to animate notifications.
3. Any style can be applied to the notifications. Hence, the color, background-color, font-size, etc. can be customized.
4. HTML text can be used to display the notification. As long as the text is valid HTML, JSAlerts will be able to display it.
